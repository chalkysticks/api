        APA/CPA 9-Ball Game Rules
    </h3>
    <p>
        9-Ball is for everyone! Here’s your chance to play the same
        game the pros play and have a great chance at winning.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>General Description</strong> - 9-Ball is played with a cue ball and
        nine object balls numbered 1 through 9. 9-Ball is a rotation
        game, meaning the balls are shot in numerical order. The
        shooter must strike the lowest numbered ball on the table
        first. The game is over when the 9-ball is pocketed. A player
        retains his turn at the table as long as he strikes the lowest
        numbered ball first and legally pockets a ball. He need not
        pocket the lowest numbered ball to continue shooting. He
        may, for example, shoot the 1-ball into the
        4-ball thus pocketing the 4. He would continue shooting and
        must, once again, strike the 1-ball first. If the shooter shoots
        the 1-ball into the 9-ball and the 9-ball is pocketed without
        committing a foul, the game is over.
    </p>
    <p>
        1. <strong>Lagging</strong> - The same as 8-Ball.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. <strong>Racking</strong> - Nine balls are used and are racked in a
        diamond shape. The 1-ball is at the front of the rack and
        on the foot spot. The 9-ball is in the center and the rest of
        the object balls can be placed in any numerical order. All
        balls should be frozen (touching) as tightly as possible. The
        breaking player may request and receive a rerack.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note 1</strong>: When using coin-operated tables, save some money
        by using all the balls in the event of a short game. Example:
        If the 3 and 9 are made on the break, the balls are reracked
        (because a 9-on-the-Snap is a winner) using the 10 and 11
        balls. The sequence in the next game is 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,10,11.
        The 11, in effect, is the “9-ball” (last ball) in this game. Do not
        say the 10 replaces the 3; it is too confusing. Shoot the balls in
        numerical order.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note 2</strong>: The breaker can demand that the lowest available
        nine balls be used each game.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. <strong>Breaking</strong> - To be a legal break, players must break from
        behind the head string. The head ball must be struck first
        and at least four object balls must be driven to the rails or a
        ball must be pocketed. The cue ball may not be shot into a
        rail before the rack. Failure to strike the 1-ball first does not
        result in a foul. If the break does not qualify as legal, the balls
        are reracked and broken by the same player. If the rack is
        struck, but the break does not qualify as legal and results in
        a scratch, the balls are reracked and broken by the opposite
        player. <strong>THE RACK MUST BE STRUCK BEFORE A FOUL
        CAN OCCUR</strong>. Breaking safe or soft is not allowed. The
        League Operator may make judgments and issue penalties
        to teams and players who are not breaking hard. Breaking
        just hard enough to comply with this rule is not a guarantee
        against penalties. Remember, break as hard as you can with
        control.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. <strong>After the Break</strong> - Various circumstances can occur upon
        completion of the break. They are:

        <ol class="alpha-list">
            <li>
                A foul on a legal break will result in ball-in-hand
                anywhere on the table for the breaker’s opponent.
                Pocketed balls, if any, stay down (are not spotted),
                except the 9-ball.
            </li>
            <li>
                No balls are pocketed and it is the other player’s turn.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 9-ball is pocketed. This is a win unless the player
                scratches, in which case the 9-ball (any other available
                high numbered ball is adequate) is spotted and the turn
                passes to his opponent.
            </li>
            <li>
                A ball or a number of balls are pocketed. It is still the
                breaker’s turn and he shoots at the lowest numbered
                ball on the table.
            </li>
            <li>
                Occasionally it occurs that a player mistakenly shoots
                the wrong ball. Although it is sportsmanlike for the
                sitting player to remind the shooting player he is about
                to foul by shooting the wrong ball, he is not required
                to do so. Once the shooter has hit the wrong ball,
                the foul has occurred whether the ball is pocketed or
                not. If the ball is pocketed, it is permissible, though
                not recommended, that the sitting player allow the
                shooting player to continue shooting until he feels
                inclined to call the foul. Any balls pocketed prior to the
                foul being called will be marked as “dead balls.” The
                shooting player can escape penalty by quietly realizing
                his error and returning to shoot the correct ball and
                striking it first on a shot prior to his opponent calling
                the foul. In other words, the sitting player must call the
                foul before the shooter has shot the correct ball.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Push-outs are fairly standard in pro events and in
        the U.S. Amateur Championship (conducted by the APA);
        however, APA rules for all handicapped competition does
        not allow push-outs.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. <strong>Combination Shots</strong> - Combination shots are legal and
        extremely common in 9-Ball. <strong>Just make sure to hit the
        lowest numbered ball on the table first</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        6. <strong>Balls on the Floor</strong> - Knocking the cue ball off the playing
        surface is a foul. <strong>Knocking an object ball on the floor is not
        a foul</strong>. Object balls that get knocked off the playing surface
        will be immediately spotted on the foot spot. If the foot spot
        is taken, the ball will be placed on a line directly behind the
        foot spot as close to the foot spot as possible. If two or more
        balls are knocked on the floor, they are placed in numerical
        order with the lowest numbered ball closest to the foot spot.
        Spotted balls are frozen to one another. It might occur that a
        player legally pockets a ball while simultaneously knocking
        some other ball(s) on the floor. In this situation, the ball(s) is
        spotted and the player continues shooting until he misses.
    </p>
    <p>
        7. <strong>Pocketed Balls</strong> - Balls must remain in a pocket to be legal.

        If a ball goes in a pocket but bounces back onto the playing
        surface, it is not considered pocketed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note 1</strong>: If a ball which has been hanging in a pocket for more
        than a few seconds suddenly falls in, it is to be placed back on the
        table where it was originally sitting. Once a ball has stopped all
        motion, it cannot move again without outside forces affecting it.
        So, if it falls in a pocket, it is to be placed back on the table where
        it was before it fell.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note 2</strong>: It occasionally happens on tables with small pockets that
        two balls become jammed in a pocket and are leaning over the
        edge of the slate to some degree. They are off the playing surface
        and are considered pocketed. Drop them in and resume playing
        the game unless the pocketing ends the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        8. <strong>Spotting Balls</strong> - Other than the circumstances described
        in <strong>Balls on the Floor</strong>, the only ball that will ever be spotted
        will be the 9-ball when the shooter has pocketed the 9-ball
        and scratched or otherwise fouled. If the shooter makes
        the 9-ball on the break and fouls or scratches, the 9-ball (and
        only the 9-ball) is spotted. If the shooter is shooting at the
        object ball and plays it into the 9-ball and pockets the 9-ball,
        but scratches or otherwise fouls in the process, the 9-ball is
        spotted. The incoming player has ball-in-hand and will be
        shooting at the lowest numbered ball on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
        9. <strong>Fouls</strong> - If any of the following fouls are committed, the
        penalty is ball-in-hand for the incoming player. Make certain
        you have ball-in-hand before you touch the cue ball by
        confirming with your opponent. Ball-in-hand means you are
        allowed to place the cue ball anywhere on the table and shoot
        the lowest numbered ball on the table. Even after having
        addressed the cue ball, a player may, if not satisfied with the
        placement, make further adjustments with the hand, cue stick
        or any other reasonable piece of equipment. A foul may be
        called only if the player fouls while actually stroking at the
        cue ball, meaning a double hit of the cue ball (sometimes
        called double clutching).
    </p>
    <p>
        The ball-in-hand rule penalizes a player for an error.
        Without this rule, a player could benefit by accidentally or
        purposely scratching or otherwise fouling.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only the player or the Team Captain may officially call a
        foul, although anyone may suggest to the player or the Team
        Captain that a foul should be called.
    </p>
    <p>
        These are the only fouls resulting in ball-in-hand. All other
        violations are sportsmanship violations. The ball-in-hand
        fouls are as follows:

        <ol class="alpha-list">
            <li>
                Anytime during a shot, the cue ball goes in a pocket,
                on the floor, or otherwise ends up off the playing
                surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                Failure to hit the correct ball first. (The correct ball is
                always the lowest numbered ball on the table.) The
                shooter has the advantage in these situations unless
                his opponent has asked an outside party to watch the
                hit. Protect yourself. If you think your opponent is
                attempting a shot that could result in a bad hit, get
                someone to watch the shot before he starts shooting.
                Teams involved in repeatedly calling bad hits without
                outside party verification may be subject to penalty
                points for disruptive unsportsmanlike behavior.
            </li>
            <li>
                Failure to hit a rail after contact. A sentence that
                should answer many questions is: “Any ball (including
                the cue ball) must go to a rail AFTER LEGAL contact.”
                A pocketed ball counts as a rail.
            </li>
            <li>
                The object ball is frozen to a rail and the player is
                contemplating playing a “safety.” In order for the
                “frozen ball” rule to be in effect, the opponent must
                declare the ball frozen and the player should verify.
                Once it is agreed the ball is frozen the player must
                drive the object ball to another rail (of course, it could
                hit another ball, which in turn hits a rail) or drive the
                cue ball to a rail after it touches the object ball. If the
                latter method of safety is chosen the player should be
                sure to obviously strike the object ball first. If the cue
                ball strikes the rail first or appears to hit both the rail
                and ball simultaneously, it is a foul unless either the
                cue ball or object ball went to some other rail.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is illegal and, therefore, a foul to jump a cue ball over
                another ball by scooping it up in the air on purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
                Receiving illegal aid (coaching from person(s) other
                than the coach) during your turn at the table.
            </li>
            <li>
                Causing even the slightest movement or altering the
                course of the cue ball, even accidentally, is a foul.
                Even dropping the chalk on the cue ball is a foul. It is
                not a foul, however, to accidentally move any other
                balls unless, during his turn at the table, a player
                moves a ball and it in turn comes in contact with the
                cue ball. Any balls moved accidentally during a shot
                must be replaced by the opponent after the shot is
                over and all balls have stopped rolling. If during the
                course of the shot, another ball stops in the position
                previously occupied by the accidentally moved ball,
                the opponent must place the accidentally moved
                ball, in an ethical manner, as close as possible to its
                original position. If it occurs before the shot, it must be
                replaced by the opponent before the shot is taken.
                Exception: If an accidentally moved ball comes in
                contact with the cue ball, creating a foul, no object ball
                will be replaced.
            </li>
            <li>
                If, during the course of a shot, the cue ball does not
                touch anything.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use caution when picking up or placing the cue
                ball in a ball-in-hand situation. The cue ball is always
                alive. If the cue ball, or the hand holding it
                or moving it, touches another ball it is a cue ball foul
                and your opponent has ball-in-hand. Be especially
                careful when picking up or placing the cue ball in a
                tight spot.
            </li>
            <li>
                The player or his coach (during a coaching time-out)
                may place the cue ball in a ball-in-hand situation. The
                same rule regarding placing the cue ball applies to the
                coach as applies to the player. If the player, or coach
                fouls in the process of placing the cue ball, it will be
                ball-in-hand for the opponent. Therefore, it should be
                the player’s choice if he wishes to place the cue ball or
                allow his coach to do so.
            </li>
